/* When should a function be static in PHP?
   [Namit Mahuvakar: June 24, 2014]
   -> Declaring class properties or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an instantiation of the class. 
      A property declared as static cannot be accessed with an instantiated class object. 
      Because static methods are callable without an instance of the object created.
   -> Note: the pseudo-variable $this is not available inside the method declared as static. */
